# Neural-Net-from-scratch

This section shows the implementation of Neural Network from scratch without the use of any high-level machine learning libraries.

All the steps required for building a fully connected neural network including functions for forward propogation, backward propogation, batch gradient descent, regularization as well as training and testing the data. Using this model we also have the option to tune the hyper-parameters i.e. learning rate, number of epochs, batch size, regularization parameter, etc. to get better accuracies

We consider the classic example of classification of MNIST dataset for numbers (0-9) with our neural net developed
