# Neural-Net-from-scratch

This section shows the implementation of Neural Network from scratch without the use of any machine learning libraries.

All the steps required for building a fully connected neural network including functions for forward propogation, backward propogation, batch gradient descent, regularization as well as training and testing the data.

We consider the classic example of classification of MNIST dataset for numbers (0-9) with this neural net
